  The module's `versions` property tells the handler not to load a module when it's loading a module that is not made for that version of Reciple. This prevents errors when sharing codes, as people tend to blindly copy and paste codes.

  ```js
  export default {
    versions: '^7', // You can also use an array, example: ['^5', '^7']
    onStart() {
      return true;
    }
  }
  ```
