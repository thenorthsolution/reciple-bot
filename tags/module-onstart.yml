  `onStart` is a required module's method. It is executed when the module is started before the client is ready. It returns a boolean to determine if the module has been successfully loaded or not.

  ```js
  export default {
    versions: '^7',
    onStart() {
      return true; // Return false to not successfuly load the module
    }
  }
  ```

  `onStart` can also return a [`Promise`](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>) that resolved to a boolean.
