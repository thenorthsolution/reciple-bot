  • When using `reciple` cli you can get the defined current working directory using `cli.cwd`
  • `process.cwd()` is where the node process is executed

  **Example:** `C:\Folder > npx reciple ./Folder2`

  ```js
  // Working directories

  process.cwd() // C:\Folder
  cli.cwd // C:\Folder\Folder2
  ```
