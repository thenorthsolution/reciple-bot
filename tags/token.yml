  Token can be configuired inside `reciple.yml` with the `token` property.

  ```yml
  # reciple.yml example
  token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
  ```
  You can also put your token into an environment variable. Just create a `.env` file and put the token there, then replace the value of `token` in the reciple.yml to `env:YOUR_TOKEN_ENV`

  ```yml
  # .env example
  TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
  ```
  ```yml
  # reciple.yml example
  token: env:TOKEN
  ```
  You can do the same concept with the cli flag
  ```bash
  npx reciple --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
  or
  npx reciple --token env:TOKEN
  ```
